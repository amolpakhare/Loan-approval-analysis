## 🏦 Loan Approval Analysis (EDA + Dashboard)

This project presents an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a bank loan dataset to uncover factors affecting loan approvals, followed by visualizations designed as a dashboard for presentation and LinkedIn sharing.

---

### 📌 Objective

Analyze customer and loan-related attributes to understand the patterns behind **loan approval** decisions using Python and data visualization.

---

### 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains:

* **Categorical Features:** Gender, Marital Status, Dependents, Education, Self\_Employed, Property Area, Credit History
* **Numerical Features:** ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan\_Amount\_Term
* **Target Variable:** Loan\_Status (Y/N)

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python 🐍
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

### 🔍 Key Takeaways

1. **Credit history** is the single most influential factor in loan approvals.
2. **Income-to-loan ratio** is more informative than raw income.
3. Applicants from **urban/semiurban areas** have higher approval rates.
4. **Married and graduate** applicants tend to be approved more often.
5. **Higher income** doesn’t always guarantee loan approval.
6. **Male applicants** had a higher approval count than female applicants.

### 📈 Visual Dashboard

Multiple plots are created and compiled into a dashboard-style format:

* Loan status distribution (Pie chart)
* Loan status by Gender, Education, Self Employment
* Credit History and Property Area impacts
* Income distribution vs Loan approval (Boxplot)

> ✅ All visualizations are formatted with enhanced colors, spacing, and saved together as **shareable dashboard images**.
